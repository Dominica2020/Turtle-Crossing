## Project 23 of 100 Days of Code
- Used python Turtle library to create a turtle crossing the street game
- Different color cars are randomly generated 
- Player moves the turtle by pressing the “up” arrow key
- If turtle collides with a car the game is over
- If turtle successfully crosses the intersection the level increases as well as the car speed. The turtle also returns back to the bottom of the screen.
